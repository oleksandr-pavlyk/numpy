==========================
NumPy 1.13.0 Release Notes
==========================

This release supports Python 2.7 and 3.4 - 3.6.

Highlights
==========


Dropped Support
===============


Deprecations
============


Build System Changes
====================


Future Changes
==============


Compatibility notes
===================

Tuple object dtypes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support has been removed for certain obscure dtypes that were unintentionally
allowed, of the form ``(old_dtype, new_dtype)``, where either of the dtypes
is or contains the ``object`` dtype. As an exception, dtypes of the form
``(object, [('name', object)])`` are still supported due to evidence of
existing use.

DeprecationWarning to error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See Changes section for more detail.

* ``partition``, TypeError when non-integer partition index is used.
* ``NpyIter_AdvancedNew``, ValueError when `oa_ndim == 0` and `op_axes` is NULL
* ``negative(bool_)``, TypeError when negative applied to booleans.
* ``subtract(bool_, bool_)``, TypeError when subtracting boolean from boolean.
* ``np.equal, np.not_equal``, object identity doesn't override failed comparison.
* ``np.equal, np.not_equal``, object identity doesn't override non-boolean comparison.
* Boolean indexing deprecated behavior dropped. See Changes below for details.

FutureWarning to changed behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See Changes section for more detail.

* ``numpy.average`` preserves subclasses
* ``array == None`` and ``array != None`` do element-wise comparison.
* ``np.equal, np.not_equal``, object identity doesn't override comparison result.


C API
~~~~~


New Features
============

``axes`` argument for ``unique``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In an N-dimensional array, the user can now choose the axis along which to look
for duplicate N-1-dimensional elements using ``numpy.unique``. The original
behaviour is recovered if ``axis=None`` (default).


Improvements
============


Changes
=======

``average`` now preserves subclasses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For ndarray subclasses, ``numpy.average`` will now return an instance of the
subclass, matching the behavior of most other numpy functions such as ``mean``.
As a consequence, also calls that returned a scalar may now return a subclass
array scalar.

``array == None`` and ``array != None`` do element-wise comparison
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Previously these operations returned scalars ``False`` and ``True`` respectively.

``np.equal, np.not_equal`` for object arrays ignores object identity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Previously, these functions always treated identical objects as equal. This had
the effect of overriding comparison failures, comparison of objects that did
not return booleans, such as np.arrays, and comparison of objects where the
results differed from object identity, such as NaNs.

Boolean indexing changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Boolean array-likes (such as lists of python bools) are always treated as
  boolean indexes.

* Boolean scalars (including python ``True``) are legal boolean indexes and
  never treated as integers.

* Boolean indexes must match the dimension of the axis that they index.

* Boolean indexes used on the lhs of an assigment must match the dimensions of
  the rhs.

* Boolean indexing into scalar arrays return a new 1-d array.  This means that
  ``array(1)[array(True)]`` gives ``array([1])`` and not the original array.
